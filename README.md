# sqlalchemy-challenge
i borrowed some code from https://github.com/philipstubbs13/sqlalchemy-challenge  Wish i spent more time on this one, sqlachemy is still a quandry for me.  i will need to rehash this over the weekend as I did not get 100% finished as i was at my daughter's wedding and my step-daughter's surgery.  ill submit what i got and see if i can add to it later.  something is better than nothing.
